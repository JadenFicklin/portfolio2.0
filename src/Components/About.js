          Hello! My name is Jaden and I’ve worked in construction a call center
          and been a financial manager, however I’ve recently gained an interest
          in web development back in 2021. My long term goal is to become an
          expert programmer.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I’ve graduated from Devmountain coding bootcamp in april 2022. And
          have since been perfecting what I know. I would love to join a team of
          coders and learn all I can.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My main focus now is to find a company I can see myself being a
          valuable asset at. Once I’ve established my grounding in anything I
          quickly adapt and grow.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          JavaScript (ES6+) <br></br>
          TypeScript<br></br>
          React<br></br>
          Node.js<br></br>
          SQL<br></br>

  );
